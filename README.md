# MAGD 150 ASSIGNMENTS
### f19magd150lab05_boyle/f19magd150lab05_boyle
The fith lab involves the theme of TV's which I chose the easy to make block tv. We also had to make 2 buttons that hold separate functions. So I made **one button** have a square/circle moving fast across the screen and the **other button** caused a square to move across the screen slowly.
### f19magd150lab06_Boyle
The sixth lab we completed has the theme of retrogames so I wanted to try to make mine based on space invaders. We also had to use commnads such as rotations, scale, etc. So I used that to help create the _"alien"_ varieties and I used a mouse click function to _"fire"_ at the _"big alien"_
### f19magd150lab09_Boyle_2019_11_13_04_00_40
The ninth lab had the theme around mirrors and images, so i decided to do 2 things. The first was tomake a normal mirror with a quick sketch version of myself. But when you click the mouse a monster appears (from crypt tv) with a scream (from five nights at freddys).
### 19magd150lab03_Boyle
The third lab had the theme of Pizza as well as moviing/looping objects. Because of that I made a looping rectagle that when you press the mouse a pizza appears. I call it the **pizza scanner** in the code.
### f19magd150lab07_Boyle
The seventh lab had the theme of nature as well as arrays and things like that so I made an array of 20 _fish_ inside a _lake_ or pond or somewhere underwater. I made the around 20 or so _fish_ spawn randomly and move randomly per refresh of the page.
